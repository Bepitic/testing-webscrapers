{"title": "Ukraine Recovery Conference - The role of academia", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20756", "description": ["The International Ukraine Recovery Conference will be held in Lugano in early July. Global players will sit at the same table to work out a new kind of Marshall Plan to chart a path for reconstruction through a comprehensive political and diplomatic process. In the run-up to the conference and in light of the Ukraine situation, we wish to approach several angles, including the role of academia.\u00a0We bring you an interview with Jean-Patrick Villeneuve, Associate Professor of Public Administration and Management at Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana (USI), Director of the Institute of Communication and Public Policy (ICPP), Head of GRIP (Public Integrity Research Group), and Co-Director of the Master's programme in Public Management and Policy (offered in collaboration with the Universities of Lausanne and Bern). His research focuses on transparency, anti-corruption, and accountability with attention to the limitations, challenges and impacts related to the implementation of these governance initiatives.", "\u00a0", "Professor Jean-Patrick Villeneuve, what is the role of academia in the light of a situation like that of Ukraine?\u00a0", "There are multiple roles. First and foremost, each academic discipline has to apply its analytical grids, theories, and methodologies to try to make sense of the situation. In the case of the Institute of Communication and Public Policy, it means notably using Public administration, political science, international relations and intercultural communication as angles of analysis for understanding the present but also trying to envisage and prepare for the future.\u00a0", "A second and equally important element today is to support Ukraine researchers. Through the Scholar at Risk Programme and USI\u2019s International Relation office support, the Institute has welcomed two Ukrainian scholars. They will be able to continue their research from their temporary homes at USI.\u00a0", "As a result, we also push forward with research projects and initiatives addressing the situation, exploring and preparing for a path forward, precisely in the same spirit as the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC2022).\u00a0", "\u00a0", "What does the public administration have to say about the situation?\u00a0", "Public administration is a relatively \u2018hands-on\u2019 discipline with a strong link to institutions. It analyses the development, deployment and impact of public policies and the management of public institutions. Therefore, we are not analysing the \u201cwhys\u201d of the current situation, nor the strategies to achieve lasting peace, but rather the conditions in which Ukraine can get back on its feet and keep moving forward.\u00a0", "Our specific focus, in line with ongoing research projects, has two distinct dynamics:\u00a0", "With the assistance of a new scholar, Dr Demyan Belyaev, we will extend our analyses of corruption dynamics to the Ukrainian context. We believe this will be an essential aspect to consider for an effective, impactful and politically supported reconstruction process. This is essential for Ukraine. A better governance framework will also be a mandatory condition imposed by funders worldwide. This will be an extension of ongoing projects funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and others such as Transparency International (TI).", "Similarly, and in line with a ", "Swiss Network for International Studies (SNIS)", "funded project, we shall address the stakeholder participation in the various processes, notably those linked to reconstruction. Who should have a voice, and how should these voices be heard.\u00a0", "Before the war, Ukraine was facing difficult realities in terms of governance. But it has been a member of the Open Government Partnership since 2011. So, there is a desire and a willingness to move forward on these issues. We need to make sure the dynamic is not lost through the current challenges and contribute, as academics, to provide solutions and to identify pitfalls.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "What has happened so far?\u00a0", "In the past few months, we organised a conference, with the participation of ASIS Svizzera Italiana and START InSight.\u00a0", "\u201cFrom Washington to the war in Ukraine, the dimension of disinformation\u201d", ". It was an opportunity to discuss disinformation, cybersecurity, new horizons of radicalisation and extremism. All themes directly address the current situation in Ukraine and are linked to other USI initiatives such as the\u00a0", "MEM", "\u00a0or\u00a0", "PEN", "\u00a0conference cycles.\u00a0", "In\u00a0the past year, Afghanistan, another troubling situation, has also been at the heart of the activities of the Institute \u2013 notably through the arrival of another Scholar at Risk,\u00a0", "Parwiz Mosamim", " analysing the status of women in Afghan administrations. \u00a0\u00a0", "\u00a0", "What would you ask?\u00a0", "That the \u2018after\u2019 starts being planned right now. The Lugano conference is a meaningful step in this direction. That a diversity of voices be heard during\u00a0the reconstruction. That the full capacity of Ukrainians, inside and outside the country, be mobilised. That science, research, know-how, and not just politics and power-relations be part of the equation. For now? For now, this means better funding for mechanisms such as Scholars at Risk. It means defining and launching new research mechanisms addressing the myriad of challenges that lay ahead.

The occasion of the 16 May conference was the release by Treccani of the volume \"The Style of Abuse\" by linguist Raffaella Scarpa. The book is a linguistic analysis of the phenomenon of domestic violence based on interviews with abusers and abused, in this case, women, although we know that victims are not always women.", "In what ways is it possible to detect \"violent\" language? Conversely, is it possible to prevent violent behaviour by being aware of such language?", "Violence is a fact, and among the interesting aspects to study is how we resort to that and, therefore, what happens first. What happens beforehand is often not physical, but it is also a language mechanism in which one of the two people is victimised through precise rhetorical choices and structures that are repeated and therefore detectable. This aspect is interesting because it gives us perspective on the study of language and communication. By paying attention to certain linguistic and discursive phenomena, we can realise how relationships based on abuse are constructed. This, in essence, is Scarpa's thesis.", "Is it possible to prevent violent behaviour by knowing the language, or can one only intervene after the event has occurred?", "What is being done at USI, which is also the focus of my research, is research about restoring conflict through dialogue: how can one intervene when there is conflict? How can dialogue be an alternative to conflict? This broadens the perspective of violence and helps understand how it is possible to intervene afterwards, for example, through conflict mediation, a method entirely based on communication and dialogue. On these issues, there has been a collaboration between the IALS institute and the IDUSI institute for quite some time now, combining the linguistic-argumentative perspective and the legal perspective on issues such as mediation and restorative justice.", "Certainly, however, the topic of domestic violence raises further questions for us about the effectiveness of a dialogic approach to violent situations in this area.

Technically, security is solved \u2013 no one can break modern encryption. So, for example, every chat message you send on WhatsApp is so well encrypted that only you and the recipient can read it!", "So why is IT security still an issue? The short answer: PICNIC. The humorous acronym stands for \u201cproblem in chair, not in computer\u201d. The user is usually the problem, not the mathematics of encryption. In fact, users in security are often called \u201cthe weakest link\u201d. Most users cannot remember passwords, and thus they choose those that are easy to guess for an attacker. It is *users* who naively click on an email that claims to come from the IT department asking them to verify their password by re-entering it on this website.", "If we want to solve IT security, we must look at ourselves, the users, and how we can avoid being \u201cthe weakest link\u201d. For more than 25 years, Prof. Cranor\u2019s work has been about creating solutions for online security and privacy that are *usable*. In fact, Lorrie created the first \u2013 and by now most prestigious \u2013 research forum for work on Usable Privacy and Security almost 20 years ago. Her well over 200 publications and her stellar citation record are equally testimony to the impact her work has had on today\u2019s research into usable privacy and security.", "Let me give you just one brief example of her research. I previously gave the example of a user falling for a fake email apparently coming from the IT department. Tricking users into giving out their passwords in this way is called \u201cphishing\u201d \u2013 a term that alludes to the act of manipulating people in order to \u201cfish\u201d for their sensitive information. We all have probably seen many such attempts sent to our inbox \u2013 most of them badly made and easily identifiable as being fake, but for companies, phishing is a huge issue as it is one of the main methods for breaking into a corporate IT system. In her work, Lorrie has, for example, developed tools that automatically alert users when they are about to click on fake links in an email or if they are about to enter sensitive information such as passwords into a fake website. She has also developed ways to train users to better identify such fake emails themselves, based on empirical studies that looked, for example, into why certain phishing attempts are more successful than others.", "But Lorrie\u2019s work not only had a direct impact on end-users by virtue of better user interfaces or training materials but also indirectly by helping policymakers to better understand and thus regulate technology. In 2016, Lorrie was invited by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to spend a year as their Chief Technologist. The FTC can be compared to the Weko (\u201ccommissione della concorrenza\u201d) here in Switzerland. Still, due to the legal landscape in the US, it has a much more direct influence on regulating technology, in particular privacy. In their appointment, the FTC cited her \u201cunique mix of technological prowess, scholarship and understanding of consumer attitudes toward privacy.\u201d", "As usual, there is no way a short laudation like this can adequately reflect the many achievements of a nominee. So let me try to sum it up as follows: Lorrie is a role model for all of us on how to do research that not only crosses interdisciplinary boundaries, but that also has an impact: academically, within the industry, and in society \u2013 by educating not only students but also citizens and policymakers.", "By awarding an Honorary Doctorate, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, upon the proposal of the Faculty of Informatics, wishes to honour Prof. Lorrie Cranor of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh \u201cfor her relentless pursuit of making privacy and security usable - including her pioneering work on privacy policies, her fundamental contributions towards understanding phishing attacks, and her active role in shaping public policy to better protect our privacy.\u201d"]},

{"title": "Freedom and the humanities - Freedom and literary criticism", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20282", "description": ["The series of interviews, Reflections on Freedom, continues. A look at the humanities in collaboration with ISI, the Institute of Italian Studies at USI. Professor Jori delves into the relationship between freedom and literary criticism.\u00a0\u00a0", "In the Italian and European cultural traditions, criticism has a constant and profound relationship with freedom. Looking back at the last century, a giant of liberal thought such as Benedetto Croce, one of the greatest writers and critics of the twentieth century, has taught that the practice of criticism can be summed up in the art of distinguishing, which is an act of freedom. What Vittore Branca, philologist and literary critic, wrote in the 1960s when reflecting on La critica forma caratteristica della civilt\u00e0 moderna (Criticism as a characteristic form of modern civilisation), is still as valuable as ever: \"It is precisely the personal value, vigorously invoked for criticism by various parties, that also reveals its moral significance in today's world, increasingly threatened by ideological anathemas and witch-hunts: that is, that of a continuous aptitude for meditation and verification, of a permanent school of freedom\". From these masters comes the example of critical practice in close relationship with freedom. In 1943, as he writes in his book Per amore di libert\u00e0, per amore di verit\u00e0, Branca was a leading figure in the liberation of Florence from Nazi fascism.\u00a0\u00a0", "From your point of view, what should the critic do?\u00a0\u00a0", "As Carlo Dionisotti taught us to do, the critic must be free in choosing, distinguishing, and placing a work in space and time. But he must also be aware that his is a voluntary servitude, an act of dedication to the work, to the reasons of the other. In his essential 1977 book La filologia e la critica letteraria (Philology and Literary Criticism), co-written with Vittore Branca, Geneva-born Jean Starobinski, a beacon of European consciousness, defines literary criticism as a relationship, as an encounter between a subject and an object, in which the freedom of the interpreter must be at the service of the subjectivity of the text. What Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote about his poetry applies to the critic's commitment: \"I will not have written a single free book, a single free verse / throughout the years\" (Libro libero).\u00a0\u00a0", "To what extent is it necessary to dwell on phrases and concepts and to what extent is it possible to express a more \"personal\" and less \"formal\" opinion? How should the critic approach the work and how should he or she 'give' it back to the public?", "\u00a0\u00a0", "Criticism cannot be thought of outside of its relationship with the institutions of literature and knowledge. At the beginning of the millennium, as a result of the digital revolution, the scope of these institutions has expanded. Today, criticism is expressed on blogs, on the internet, with the risk of becoming confused with gossip, with common opinion, with conformism, which is the opposite of freedom. An anchorage to reality, a powerful vaccine, is the relationship of criticism with philology, as indicated again by the essential book I mentioned earlier. In its techniques, in its attention to detail, in the art of distinguishing, philology finds a constant proof of its fairness. No less important is erudition, which is not to be confused with the dust that settles on books but consists, as Italo Calvino pointed out, in the utopian search for the apocryphal, forgotten book capable of changing the meaning of the books of the canon. Perhaps criticism today serves to indicate reasons for rereading rather than reasons for reading. Among the institutions of knowledge in the historical and literary spheres, journals must be safeguarded: international evaluation protocols tend to make them more rigid, to reduce them to the rank of competition arenas, but they, especially those with a more distinctive cultural tradition, must instead be tenaciously guarded as spaces of freedom.\u00a0\u00a0", "What advice would you give to those approaching this line of work?\u00a0\u00a0", "Do not comply with cultural trends, which are the death of freedom; acquire a vast culture, with a deep curiosity, with a genuine love for truth and freedom. The first piece of advice that Leopardi gave to the readers of his verses was to read with attention, which the great poet Paul Celan defined in the second half of the last century as follows: \"For the poem heading toward the other, everything and everyone is a figure of this other. The attentiveness that the poem pays to all that it encounters, its more acute sense of detail, outline, structure, colour, but also of \"palpitations\" and \"innuendos\", all this, I believe, is not the conquest of an eye in competition (or in concomitance) with equipment that is more perfect every day, but rather a concentration with all our dates in mind\". This is not just a declaration of poetics, but a perfect synthesis of the critic's work. It is the \"philological fury\" that Pier Paolo Pasolini, a critic of literature and art as well as politics and society, asked of his readers in order to be understood and that we must rediscover today in order to protect freedom.\u00a0", "\u00a0"]},

Students will learn about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain, focusing on three levels: business, regulation and technology. Specifically, topical issues will be covered, such as consensus mechanisms, stablecoins, digital assets, tokenisation, compliance and AML procedures, blockchain data tracking, cybersecurity, DeFi/Dao, sustainable mining, etc. At the culmination of the programme, Plan \u20bf Summer School participants will present the results of their hands-on projects and have the opportunity to meet industry leaders creating new employment or business opportunities. Speakers will include prominent industry leaders, including Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, and Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner of Fulgur Ventures. \"Within Plan \u20bf, education is a relevant aspect and one that is particularly close to my heart.

There are extensive areas of archaeological significance in the territory, professional associations and public events generate interest, and there are even those who - although working mainly in Southern Switzerland - have received important international accolades. Discovering and protecting archaeological sites and cultural heritage locally and internationally is undoubtedly a fascinating challenge.\u00a0We talk about it with Marcello Fidanzio, associate professor at the USI-affiliated Faculty of Theology in Lugano, director of the Institute of Culture and Archaeology of Biblical Lands FTL and a member of the USI-FTL Center for Goren Monti Ferrari Judaica.\u00a0", "Professor Fidanzio, is it possible to be an archaeologist in Ticino?", "\n\"Currently, the Canton of Ticino has outstanding archaeologists who have reached top positions. I am thinking, for example, of Andrea Bignasca, director of the Antiken Museum in Basel and the magazine \"Quaderni Ticinesi di Numismatica e Antichit\u00e0 Classiche\" or Simonetta Biaggio-Simona, head of the Canton's Office of Cultural Heritage. Then there are several scholars of the younger generation who have completed or are pursuing valuable studies. The limitation lies in the fact that university education takes place elsewhere. In the last fifteen years in Lugano, we have started an academic track with the Institute of Culture and Archaeology of Biblical Lands in the Faculty of Theology, now affiliated with USI. We are seeing the first results.\"", "Can you give us some examples?", "\n\"We have a summer archaeology programme in Jerusalem taught by archaeologists from different schools, denominations, and political affiliations. Twelve universities send their students every summer, and the course is recognised in their academic programmes. Lugano's name has also made its way into research on the archaeology of the Dead Sea Scrolls, with conferences organised in Ticino, archaeological excavations at the caves, and the commission to publish together with the \u00c9cole Biblique et Arch\u00e9ologique of Jerusalem the report on the excavations at the caves where the Scrolls were found.\"\u00a0", "In 2019 you were awarded the Biblical Archaeology Society's prize for the best scholarly publication in archaeology in the last two years: for what work of yours?", "\n\"The award came unexpectedly for the volume The Caves of Qumran, which stemmed from the conference held in Lugano in 2014, where for the first time, archaeologists and text scholars came together to work on the caves where the Scrolls were found. The award recognised the path we had taken: we understood we were on the right track. Then we submitted a project to the Swiss National Fund, and today thanks to the support we received, we can work with ease and with the quality that such a task requires.\"", "How vivid is the interest in archaeology in Ticino?", "\n\"The risk for those working in universities is to close themselves in a bubble populated by insiders. In Ticino, my experience is that of a very receptive audience. Whenever we have offered public initiatives, the numbers have always been high and growing, and so has the interest. I still have vivid emotions about the last event before the pandemic. It was 4 February 2020, and we dedicated a half-day to presenting our work on Qumran using different languages: the immersive experience in the caves (together with USI Academy of Architecture in Mendrisio), a new documentary, a round table with leading international research figures. The auditorium of the University was bursting with people (standing, sitting, even on the steps...), and until late at night, we were asked to continue replaying the documentary. But if we talk about the relationship with the territory, there is above all the activities of the Ticino Archaeological Association: a presence that combines great participation and excellence of proposals.\"", "The Ticino Archaeological Association (AAT), founded in 1986, aims to bring together all enthusiasts of this fascinating discipline: how do you view it in international comparison?", "\n\"I truly admire the AAT. Even in Paris, the initiatives of a similar association do not reach the numbers of the ones present in Ticino. But it is not just a matter of numbers: interactions show the quality of participation. We know that one of the commitments of the University is the so-called \"third mandate\". In a context where the University in Ticino is only recently taking its first steps toward archaeology, the \"third mandate\" is already largely accomplished.\u00a0I would also like to mention another reality, this time valuable in the field of research: the \"Quaderni ticinesi di Numismatica e Antichit\u00e0 Classiche,\" a scientific journal that reached fifty years of publication this year. In Ticino, we do not yet have structured academic paths, but there are many quality groups that carry on the interest in archaeology.\"", "Recently a new research project of yours was announced on the Great Isaiah Scroll as an archaeological object.

The new research project involves studying this scroll as an archaeological object, focusing on non-textual information.

A Look at the Humanities in collaboration with the Institute of Italian Studies at USI. In this round, Fabio Pusterla, professor of Italian language and literature at USI, explores the relationship between freedom and literary translation.\u00a0", "Professor Pusterla, What is literary translation in the first place?", "Nowadays, we think of literary translation as a particular form of writing. The \"what to write\" pre-exists the writing, while the \"how to write\" is, precisely as in writing on one's own, a constant adventure and invention. In this challenging exercise, the poetics of the author comes into contact with the poetics of the translator, with remarkably complex effects. The text, written in its original language, carries within itself a dialogue with the tradition behind it, with the works that the author had read and cherished, with the time in which it was written. The translation will have to take these aspects into account and, at the same time, however, add new ones: because the language of translation, that is, the unique linguistic and cultural space that the original text will end up inhabiting, opens up in turn reference markers. In this way, translation is indeed an extraordinary force field and not simply, as once thought, a service operation.", "To what extent are freedom and translation related?", "Freedom is, or should be, to get out of the generality of a term that is often abused today, a constant dialectic between rights and duties, between boundless desire and necessary limitation. In this sense, translation presents remarkable analogies with this vision of freedom: I am free, in translating, to exercise my inventive and creative abilities to the fullest degree; but at the same time, I am bound by the need to be respectful of the original, to establish a loyal dialogue with that text. There was a time when one would have spoken of fidelity: but this is a term that risks creating too many misunderstandings. Better to settle for loyalty, which seems to open a broader and less ambiguous horizon. Loyalty, indeed, leaves a wide margin of action for translators but, at the same time, binds them to an original, profound pact.", "What should the translator's activity be? Is there, for example (or should there be), a difference in approach or style between the more \"technical\" translator and the literary translator?", "The two different figures of translators, the literary and the technical translator, obviously have something in common, but they also experience very different situations. Technical translators usually have to work fast; they are paid quite well; they translate texts that have practical utility (leaflets, advertising texts, user manuals, regulations and laws, and so on), and they usually have to be very careful about the precise meaning of words, the technical register to be used, and much less about the stylistic aspects of the text. Literary translators, on the other hand, can usually take their time to get into the text to be translated and work on it at a very leisurely pace; they are paid very little (or sometimes nothing at all), and they feel it is their overriding duty to restore the stylistic tone of the original text. Moreover, technical translators mostly do not choose what to translate: they receive an assignment or a commission and get to work. In the case of the literary translator, however, elective affinities can play an important role. For example, I do not think I would be able to translate a text that I do not like or understand.", "In your opinion, can one say that the translator is a second author?", "Like I suggested earlier, I think so. But, provided you understand that we do not overemphasize this aspect, we do not give this \"second author\" too much autonomy or freedom of action. Translators are undoubtedly authors of a sort, even when they cannot boast of a work of their own: they are so in the very act of translating. Still, at the same time, a translator is also always a servant of the original text, feeling the importance and power of the latest at every moment. Seen in this light, translators are, to borrow some very ancient imagery, simultaneously knights and squires (and for that matter, the ever-elusive Angelica of Orlando Furioso, whom we might also be tempted to identify with the poem of the text, will choose Medorus, not one of the more famous knights who pursue her throughout the poem. As if to say, continuing the metaphorical reading, the poem can offer itself as much to the translator/scholar as to the author/knight. It is not necessarily the case that the latter has more merit than the former).", "In what ways do you feel connected to the original text?", "In addition to what I have already said, I might add one thing to pick up on the part of the question that I overlooked. Years ago, participating as a literary translator in an assembly of technical translators, I asked some of the latter what they thought was the most challenging type of text to translate (in literature, we would say: the most formally complex and structured text, which we often identify with the poetic text). After a not-so-short consultation, they answered me: the instructions for board games are the hardest thing to translate because first you have to learn how to play, and only after that you can try to work on the text. In a way, it seems to me that something similar happens with literary translation: before I begin. I have to enter deeply into the fabric of the original text; I have to learn to inhabit it, listen to its innermost voice, and play its very serious game. And then, try to reinvent these things in another language, in another dimension", ".", "Which things do you feel free to change and which ones do not? How do you figure out what can be done?", "There are no absolute answers. If translation is \"the supreme critical act, \" as some have argued,\" it will mean that the translator will have to make some critical and painful choices. What aspect of the text I am about to translate seems to me in principle indispensable, so important that I subordinate to that aspect any losses in other areas of the text? In short, translation is always an interpretation, as we see clearly by comparing the work of different translators who have dealt with the same text. To give just one example: how to translate Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, that is, a capital work in which the dialogue between formal clarity and sulfurous semantic aspects is brought to incandescence and perfection? What should be privileged during translation: rhythm, meter, rhyme, rhetorical arrangement of the text, semantic and imaginative background? There is no single answer, let alone one correct answer. The many translators who have tackled this masterpiece have performed multiple interpretive and stylistic operations, none of which is right or wrong.", "Should you give any advice to those approaching this profession?", "I am not a professional translator. I have never experienced translation as a real job but as a form of exploration of language and culture, different from and supportive of the poetry writing I try to practice. Perhaps, for this reason, I could not give precise advice. Still, I could take up the beautiful and ironic words with which a poet, Aurelio Buletti, responded many years ago to a somewhat similar question: what would you recommend to a young person who intends to devote to poetry? Buletti replied, \"modesty, patience and the illusion of immortality.\" These seem to be clear, habitable words (this, too, if I remember correctly, is an expression of Buletti's), which I could subscribe to. And suppose the first two ingredients, patience and modesty, rightly induce caution and distrust of hyperbole. In that case, the last is that breath of wind and utopia that runs through all forms of writing, including translation."]},

This collaboration has been articulated over time in different ways (projects, consultancies, study mandates, in-depth studies and participation in events). The latest instance was particularly relevant as it is part of the initiatives carried out by the AITI association to celebrate its anniversary. Barbara Antonioli Mantegazzini, vice-director of the Institute for Economic Research and adjunct professor at USI Faculty of Economics, and Moreno Baruffini, PhD researcher and head of the Observatory of Economic Dynamics (O-De) at the Institute for Economic Research (IRE), talked to us about it.", "In preparation for the assembly on 1 June 2022, which will also mark precisely the 60th anniversary of the association, AITI is drafting a \"Strategic Plan for Economic Development\" aimed at highlighting the role of industry as a pivotal element in the economic and social development of the Canton of Ticino.

Traditionally, IRE has been a reference point in applied research while providing services to Ticino's economy and institutions (public and private). The interplay between a solid academic research methodology and a concrete vision of the territory's vocation and needs was at the basis of AITI's decision to give IRE a study mandate to carry out a critical and detailed analysis of the current conditions as well as the degree of competitiveness of the cantonal territory, also declined at the regional level, with particular reference to the industrial sector. The results have enabled AITI, which is also in parallel dialogue with internal working groups, to understand better the distinctive aspects, opportunities and threats of the local industrial system, fostering greater comprehensiveness of the cantonal economic development proposals to be formulated by the association.", "Why an analysis of Ticino's industrial fabric?", "Ticino's industrial sector represents one of the backbones of the regional and national economy. While it is true that recent decades have witnessed a gradual tertiarisation of the economic system, it is equally valid that industry remains a strategic player in the area. Indeed, companies are often at the root of technological innovation processes, encouraging their adoption and diffusion. This allows them to be more competitive, even and especially within a production scenario marked by significant changes and challenges.", "Based on these considerations, IRE has chosen to carry out the analysis with a survey methodology that privileges the knowledge and know-how embedded in the goods and services produced by companies. Regions whose residents and organisations have a higher level of knowledge are indeed capable of producing a more diverse and exclusive set of goods. As the amount of knowledge required to produce a specific good (more or less complex) increases, the number of regions capable of producing it decreases. As a result, if an area stands out for producing a wide range of goods or manufacturing complex products, it will be highly competitive nationally or internationally. This is a methodological approach that also captures the role of technological innovation clear synthesis of knowledge and research.", "What has emerged? What can we say about the competitiveness of Ticino's territory and industry?", "The cross-reading of diversity and exclusivity made it possible to identify the competitive positioning of Ticino's industry compared to other Swiss cantons. For completeness and consistency of the analysis, given the nature of our region as a border territory, the comparison also took into account the main provinces of Lombardy. What emerged was an interesting and not obvious snapshot of the canton's potential and limitations.", "Ticino, along with many Swiss cantons and some Italian provinces, has a high diversity of the set of goods produced, which is positive, corrected downward by a lower degree of exclusivity. However, this is a common condition for highly interconnected and developed areas. Going into greater detail on sectoral complexity, we see that the most complex sectors include, in the case of Ticino, electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply and construction. Finally, at the industry level, the peripheral districts have a high share of employment in the secondary sector, in which they specialise. Put differently: services are highly concentrated in cities, while secondary employment is present in all canton areas.", "We report the picture of a region undergoing profound change, where, however, an industrial mix of small and medium-sized enterprises still forms the \"backbone\" of the canton's economy. And this heterogeneity is both a value and a strength: it enables dynamism and specialisation. A heterogeneous production fabric also fosters possible collaboration, which is especially essential for and among smaller firms."]},
{"title": "Light pollution and the quality of sleep", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20501", "description": ["Although light pollution may seem like a minor problem, it is actually harmful to many living things, including humans. Indeed, the unnatural presence of light affects the biological rhythms of organisms, interfering with migration, reproductive cycles, sleep and other activities. Light pollution is thought to be a major player in the decline of some species and compromises the quality of life of millions of people. We delve into the topic with Mauro Manconi, a full professor at USI Faculty of Biomedical Sciences and the University of Bern and head of service at the Neurocentro della Svizzera Italiana, responsible for the Sleep Medicine Service at the same institute.\u00a0", "How much does light pollution affect sleep quality? \u00a0", "The intrusion of unnecessary light into the outdoor and indoor environment is a progressively increasing phenomenon that has received little attention until a few years ago. When talking about light pollution, we mean an alteration of the natural nighttime light level operated by any artificial light source. Light sources have an important impact on the so-called \"circadian cycle\", that is, on the 24-hour course followed by numerous biological parameters such as blood pressure, cortisol secretion, insulin secretion, mood, cognitive performance, and especially sleep. Indeed, light is a potent inhibitor of melatonin, the neurohormone that synchronises the circadian cycle of biological functions. The groups most exposed to light pollution are night shift workers and people living in metropolitan areas. Not surprisingly, night shift workers are three times more likely than daytime workers to develop sleep disorders. Unfortunately, artificial light has an impact not only on humans but also on animals and plants and microorganisms such as bacteria, with global repercussions, even on the process of cleaning air pollution that takes place mainly at night. Within our homes, the primary source of illumination that invades the evening/night hours is produced by electronic devices such as cell phones, TVs, tablets and PCs. Those sources are enough to suppress melatonin production and cause a new and progressively increasing form of insomnia called \"Techno-insomnia,\" which is particularly affecting young people.\u00a0", "What is the situation with light pollution in Switzerland? \u00a0", "Light pollution generally happens in highly populated urban areas. In Europe, the region of Lombardy and Belgium have a negative record, followed closely by London. In Switzerland, the situation is better. However, it is harder to find a place with \"natural darkness\" even here. The Swiss regions most affected by the phenomenon are the cantons of Zurich and Geneva, while in Ticino, it is the Sottoceneri and particularly Lugano that suffers the most light pollution.", "\u00a0", "Do the Swiss sleep well? Is there any data on the situation in Ticino?\u00a0", "It is difficult to answer these questions for two reasons. First, because there are more than 80 different sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and daytime sleepiness, to name the most frequent. Second, no studies are available on a large Swiss sample on the prevalence of insomnia, let alone in Ticino. In purely quantitative terms, in the world rankings, Japanese people sleep the least (about 6 hours/day) and the New Zealanders the most (about 8 hours/day). Switzerland ranks well with an average sleep of about 7.15 hours/day, along with Germany and the United States, higher than Italy and Spain but lower than France and the Netherlands. In Ticino, there is still little cultural and health attention to the issue of sleep, which, judging by the average consumption of sleeping pills among Ticino residents, does not seem to be in the best of health, still being among the highest in Switzerland.\u00a0", "What are the effects of light pollution on bedtime, and what are the interferences during sleeping hours? \u00a0", "Excessive light, especially exposure to light at the wrong times, including evenings and nights, might postpone bedtime and be associated with difficulty in falling asleep and staying asleep, resulting in sleep deprivation. The circadian cycle is altered by light. This is why light is also used as a therapy, i.e., capable of shifting the sleep phase in a different direction depending on the time at which it is administered. For therapeutic purposes, e.g., in phase delay syndrome (significant postponement of the sleep-wake cycle), by administering a white light for 20 to 30 minutes upon waking up in the morning, it is possible to stretch the sleep phase forward by about 1.5 hours after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. Difficulty in falling asleep and increased intra-sleep awakenings, essentially insomnia and sleep deprivation in general, are only the first negative effect of abnormal light exposure. Altering the circadian cycle of numerous biological functions also increases the risk of psychological, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the long term. In fact, fundamental protective activities such as anti-inflammatory or antioxidant activities, which are important in the neurodegenerative and oncological spheres, occur in sleep.\u00a0", "What disorders can interrupted or altered sleep cause? \u00a0", "The first effect in temporal terms of prolonged sleep deprivation is psychological and cognitive. Mood decline, irritability, daytime sleepiness, problems with memory, attention, learning in children, and the ability to make context-appropriate choices are the first symptoms of chronic insomnia or generally reduced sleep in quantity or quality, even in the context of disorders other than insomnia, see, for example, sleep apnea. If sleep disturbances persist over time, the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular events, diabetes, fertility problems, gastrointestinal disorders, and possibly obesity and cancer increases. \u00a0", "How much does exposure to fine particulate and nitrogen oxide that form that yellowish haze that looms over the world's metropolitan skies affect sleep quality?\u00a0", "\nAs is well known, air pollution increases the risk of numerous diseases, among them undoubtedly respiratory infections, and reduces life expectancy. We have less data on the effects of air pollution on sleep than on light pollution, but still enough to show a negative impact on sleep of particulate matter (PM), ozone and nitrogen oxide. Moreover, air pollution and sleep apnea synergistically increase health impairment. In particular, children and the elderly appear to have more vulnerable sleep when exposed to air pollution. How pollution can negatively affect sleep quality has yet to be clarified. Indeed, the nerve centre of sleep-breathing and allergy-related mechanisms could explain part of these effects. Besides, air pollution significantly increases oncological, cardiovascular, and psychiatric risks, all of which cannot be separated from sleep, which alone takes up about one-third of our lives. \u00a0", "Sleeping well is essential for keeping good physical and mental health. Unfortunately, however, millions of people worldwide get little and poor sleep. What long-term consequences can occur if the situation does not change?\u00a0", "On the topic of sleep duration over time, there is still disagreement in the scientific literature. Some studies indicate that the adult population has lost about 1 hour of sleep in the past 30 years, from 7.5 to 6.5 hours, while other studies show substantial stability in sleep duration in previous decades. Undoubtedly, taking an afternoon nap, which is a beneficial and physiological habit, has been lost. However, more consistent data concern sleep disorders, which tend to increase. It is estimated that about 30% of adults chronically have insomnia, with twice the prevalence in women and an average duration between 2 and 6 years. About 5% suffer from a significant form of sleep apnea, especially men; about 5% from restless legs syndrome; and about 10% of adults suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep disorders are also common in youth, where 30% of preschool children suffer from sleep disorders, which tend to fade in school-age and recur in adolescence. Enuresis, for example, has a psychophysical impact and affects 5 per cent of 10-year-olds and 3 per cent of 16-year-olds. These numbers are unfortunately not yet supported by adequate information. Few actions are being taken regarding culture and sleep education compared to what is being done in the fight against smoking or in support of children's dental hygiene. The problem of growing consumption of stimulant drinks and cell phone use in young people is still underestimated and has a significant impact on sleep and the quality of life.\u00a0", "\n\u00a0"]},

{"title": "Freedom in the humanities - Property, slavery and freedom in the history of law", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20531", "description": ["The interview series ", "Freedom and the Humanities ", "continues in collaboration with USI Institute of Italian Studies. In this round, Dario Mantovani, professor of History of Late Ancient Institutions and holder of the Droit, culture et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Rome antique chair at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris, will talk to us about Property, Slavery and Freedom in the History of Law.", "When we talk about freedom, we use a word that comes from Latin. So what does its history tell us?", "It has an even more ancient origin. Its root is found in various Indo-European languages, including Greek-all societies that evidently knew the division between free and unfree. Probably, the common root means \"to grow.\" At first glance, it is a far cry from our idea of \"freedom,\" but the interest of history is to make us think, to find unexpected connections. The word liber - precisely because it is related to \"grow up\" - designated belonging to a group (to a people or a family: free was also used to refer to \"children\"). Belonging is expressed through the metaphor of growth, of vegetation. It is the same idea, after all, as the genealogical \"tree.\" In opposition, the slave is the one who does not belong to the group. In short, \"freedom\" already arises with the opposite term implied. The English word freedom has different roots but encapsulates a similar idea: it comes from a root meaning \"to love,\" \"to hold dear,\" probably applied to members of one's group or family. \u00a0", "Almost a binary friend/enemy logic.", "Yes. After all, the leading cause of enslavement was precisely war captivity, the capture of the enemy. This also explains why there was no link between slavery and ethnicity in Rome. In other words, there was no racial connotation to the practice of enslavement. Whatever the \"nationality,\" it was being captured in a war that determined the loss of freedom. This does not detract from the fact that the Romans felt that slaves from specific populations were closer to them in customs and mentality than others. But, precisely, slavery is prescinded from ethnicity. It differs considerably from slavery, which has developed since the 16th century. Moreover, the Romans widely practised the manumission of slaves, who thus became free citizens, giving Rome a multi-ethnic connotation.", "It is said that it is difficult to define what freedom is. Can the Romans help us?", "Fiorentino, a jurist who lived around 200 A.D., left this definition: \"Freedom is the natural ability to do what each person likes to do unless he is prevented from doing it by force of law.\" It is a very clear definition and a beautiful one because it can be applied to so many fields: to do what one wants, that is, freedom. But, of course, because we live in societies, there are limits, summarised by two aspects, force and law. Force is the obstacle that others impose on us abusively. Laws are the limits designed for us to interact harmoniously in a group. Interestingly, in turn, the law also serves to remove the obstacles that others impose on us by force. In short, freedom, as a space for action and fulfilment, has much to do with its adequate protection by law.", "In the definition, I was struck by the adjective \"natural.\" It reminds me of Article 1 of the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\"", "Indeed, this article is directly influenced by this text and similar ones in Justinian's Digest, the volume that collects the principles of Roman law and has profoundly marked modern Western legal culture. But the paradox lies in the fact that this declaration of \"the natural liberty of all men\" comes from a society that practised slavery. The truth is that the ancients distinguished this natural state from what could then happen if one was captured or born to a mother who was herself enslaved. The significant breakthrough of modernity was to make the natural state of freedom coincide with the legal form of freedom. Slavery was abolished, and today effectively, all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. \u00a0", "Today, however, there are dramatic situations of enslavement: migrant trafficking, child labour, and sexual exploitation.\u00a0", "It is a plague which seems to stem from an instinct of overpowering that is not only from ancient times. The Geneva Convention of 1926 defines slavery as \"the state or condition of an individual over whom the attributes of the right of ownership or some of them are exercised.\" Reflecting on ancient slavery-which was precisely the legal condition of being wholly subject to the power of a dominus-can help to better focus on these situations of subjugation. By reflecting on the legal requirement of the ancient slave, one can easily recognize all cases today that, under another name, unacceptably impair personal freedom.", "Indeed, freedom and its opposite seem closely related.", "Yes, and so are individual freedom and collective freedom. The Romans distinguished free people from others, saying that \"free\" are the people who are not subject to the power of any other people (in short, just as free is a person who has no master). This is a definition that can help guide us in the international political dimension. But, precisely because the shadow of its opposite always accompanies freedom, we must be ever vigilant to defend it."]},
{"title": "Freedom and the Humanities - The reader's freedom and the ethics of literature", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20108", "description": ["Today, we launch a series of insights on freedom, curated by the professors of the Institute of Italian Studies at USI. In this first issue, we asked Professor Stefano Prandi, Director of the Institute, to discuss the freedom of the reader and the ethics of literature.", "Let us start from the concept of reader freedom. How should it be understood?", "There is always a tendency to associate a positive but somewhat trivial value with reading. In school, we often heard the phrase \"Read, it's good for you\" as if it were a sporting activity. It is true, it is indeed good advice, but it must be clear that when approaching a text, in reality, readers measure themselves - and sometimes clash - with diversity, just as it happens when we converse with someone who does not share our opinions. The text can be considered an \"individual\" with a precise physiognomy, standing in front of in a non-neutral way. As Jean-Paul Sartre observed, it challenges us to respond in some way. It can do so because, even though it is different from us, the text speaks a language that is mainly common to ours. It evokes topics that concern us. Therefore, readers have the freedom to read what they like or even to stop reading a book that does not interest them. Still, they are also invested with a specific responsibility, consisting of a sincere and profound confrontation with what they read. Readers freely choose to welcome the text into their most intimate sphere. As George Steiner clearly understood, reading in this sense is an act of hospitality, an invitation to open our home to a stranger whom we do not yet know and who could perhaps disappoint us.", "How does this dialogue take place in the literary text?", "Literary language is not simply a recipient from which we can extract meanings at our leisure, as in a self-service restaurant. It is a real experience that can also bring about significant transformations in all of us. The literary text confronts us with possible worlds, with hypotheses of reality that, even if they are not true, are nonetheless plausible; in doing so, it exercises our ability to interpret facts and behaviours with which we could be confronted tomorrow. Therefore, the text is a gym where our intelligence, our intuition, and even our ethical sense are tested because we are often urged to make moral judgments about the characters and situations that the author has created. As Franco Brioschi has suggested, the interpretive act of the reader constitutes a crystal-clear example of \"practical knowledge\", that is, a form of knowledge that uses one's concrete individuality as an instrument of measurement. It is not only a matter of aesthetics: literature does not limit itself to adding another bit of beauty to the world, but questions itself, as Tzvetan Todorov has observed, \"about right and wrong\". By asking real questions, readers are exposed to doubt and not afraid to change their views. Those who seek only constant validation of what they expect and already know are not truly free. It is, unfortunately, what we have seen in large part of public opinion in the last two years, first with the pandemic, now with the war in Ukraine: these \"ideas\", if we want to call them so, are impervious to any fact of reality, remain unchanged even if denied by the evidence.", "In his Poetics, a work that is the basis of all subsequent reflections on the power of the word, Aristotle had said: \"Those who by their very nature are emotional are more credible [...]; those who are agitated and those who are angry are keener to be agitated, and those who are angry are more likely to be moved to anger\"; poetics, therefore, Aristotle concludes, is the art of the \"versatile\" or of the \"elevated\": the first is \"adaptable\", the second is \"inclined to emerge from himself\". It is precisely in this open space, in this willingness of the \"id\" to cross the perimeter of its own boundaries to discover the new, the different, the other, that the ethical vocation of literature is fulfilled. As my teacher Ezio Raimondi wrote, in the dialogue between text and reader, something paradoxical happens: the more the former shows its diversity with respect to the latter, the more the latter intensifies the feeling of proximity and empathy with respect to what he reads: the experience of the writer, therefore, who is sometimes far away in time from the reader, is turned into \"living memory\". The ethics of reading is revealed here as an experience of freedom, which is accomplished \"in full awareness of the other.\"", "What role does this experience of the freedom of reading and literature play in higher education?", "A decisive role. The word literature indicates a repeated and constant action that can gradually form our skills and vision of the world. Almost all the most important things in life grow slowly as trees. In today's world, young people find few opportunities to experience this \"inner length\" because everything is instantaneous, simultaneous and virtual. Every day, we are hit by a flood of contradictory and often unverified information: the risk of alienation or total rejection is high.", "\nFor this reason, I believe it is essential, more than ever, to give students back their legitimate right to be citizens in the domain of the word. Only through an awareness of the historical depth and the differences that bring meaning will they be able to face the challenge of complexity, overcoming the deceptive illusions to which they are continually exposed. In this way, they will be able to recognise and conquer their complete singularity as people. In conclusion, I believe that the most important thing that literature can continue to offer to society through educational institutions is an \"ecology of the mind\" (Gregory Bateson) that allows us to place ourselves at the proper distance from the chaotic buzz that surrounds us without isolating in splendid solitude.

In the modern age, starting from the acceleration given by the French Revolution, those concepts have taken on different meanings, which have inevitably been affected by the contexts of reference. From a historical point of view, by observing the transformations that give meaning to the presence of men in society over time (Marc Bloch), it is therefore important to avoid making generalisations that prevent us from grasping the interweaving of continuities and ruptures that run through the course of such complex phenomena.\u00a0", "What are the passages that mark the debut of these concepts in the contemporary age?\u00a0", "The revolutionary fracture at the end of the 18th century is decisive: removed from its claimed divine origin, the legitimation of power was transferred to the body of popular will, with disruptive effects on political life and the languages and practices of patriotic education.\u00a0", "During the European \"long nineteenth century\", the freedom of people was inextricably linked in many countries with the affirmation of the principles of nationality, the demand for a constitution, and the aspiration for the nation-state. The \"peoples' spring\" of 1848, with the uprisings that exploded in so many European cities, well conveys the echoes of those forceful words, as well as the hopes, the results, the defeats: at the same time, those events highlight the different interpretations given by the forces engaged in the field of political competition and the organisation of society (moderate liberals, democrats, socialists, Catholics, etc.).\u00a0", "Are there similarities or gaps between the 19th and 20th centuries?\u00a0", "Some scholars underline the continuity between nineteenth-century nationalism and that which asserts itself in the twentieth century within regimes such as Italian Fascism and German National Socialism (but not only). There is no doubt that in the national \"discourse\", there are formulas that recur punctually over time: the nation as a community of descent, honour, martyrdom, religious codes and symbols applied to the \"new politics\" of the masses. On the other hand, the same words have had profoundly different meanings and impacts in the individual instances and contexts in which they have entered into relation with society. The bond between nation and freedom as found, to cite an exemplary case, in the thought of Giuseppe Mazzini, underwent a progressive erosion at the turn of the century: a new type of nationalism developed from then on, increasingly linked to the imperialistic race and aimed at exalting the exclusive character of the nation.\u00a0", "Was there a difference in pattern in the period between the two world wars?\u00a0", "I believe there is a difference between the concept of homeland, the one of nation from the nineteenth century, and the aggressive version of the first half of the twentieth century. In the years of the Great War (1914-18), various visions of freedom, nation and country were evoked to support the war effort: among others, the most radical nationalisms, the Bolshevik revolutionaries and the United States with Wilson's 14 points. In the decades between the two world wars, the three prevailing models (parliamentary liberalism, fascism, communism) embodied their respective ambitions to shape the contours of a new society. In the case of totalitarian regimes, the freedoms and rights of the individual dear to liberal doctrine gave way to the role of the State and the Party, which took upon themselves the task of \"educating\" citizens on the values of national regeneration.\u00a0", "What about the second half of the twentieth century?", "Since the Second World War, freedom, homeland, and nation have not ceased to exert their influence. Just think of the phenomenon of the European Resistance and the struggle for liberation against Nazi fascism: or the processes of decolonisation, which have leveraged the principle of self-determination of peoples, the freedom to be conquered, a nationalism that is intertwined with the new Third World ideologies. The scene following the fall of the Berlin Wall, which put an end to the ideological polarisation of the Cold War, was no less linear. The regained freedom of the people of Central and Eastern Europe took on specific connotations in individual national contexts, reactivating notions of homeland and nation that seemed to have faded away. The wars that ripped apart the territories of former Yugoslavia tragically summarise all the contradictions of that process."]},

{"title": "Youth and information", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/18259", "description": ["Nearly one-third of young people in Switzerland have little to no interest in the news. Various studies show that daily world events are of secondary importance to them. They rarely use information sources and thus develop limited literacy in dealing with and processing news, which makes them more susceptible/vulnerable to misinformation. So, how can we examine the relationship between the younger generation and information today? Helping us with the answer is Eleonora Benecchi, lecturer-researcher at USI Faculty of Communication, Culture and Society. She collaborated in the study Reaching Swiss Digital Natives with News, conducted by Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana with the Universities of Zurich and Lausanne.\u00a0", "The study involved a panel of 66 people between the ages of 12 and 20 from the three linguistic regions of Switzerland. It sought to provide solutions by analysing the demands and expectations of young people regarding news, the media, information consumption, and the so-called media literacy. ", "With this in mind, we ask ourselves what piece of information are\u00a0young people seeking? And what type\u00a0of news are they looking for?\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Let us start from the premise that information means something different for young people than it does for journalists: traditional media see the news as information that should be known. Young audiences perceive it the same way (to some extent). Still, they also take into consideration other factors such as what is useful to know, what is interesting to know, and what is fun to know according to their taste. The results of our research shine a light precisely on the young people's demand for programmes and information content designed for them, which can better match their reality and cover the topics that affect them most. It does not mean that they need pure shallow entertainment. Topics such as politics, economics or social issues were mentioned as content that could be interesting and in high demand, provided that it is packaged in formats that meet their needs. We were also given concrete examples: a monthly online magazine or an app with regular updates that sums up current events in an understandable and easily accessible way, through images or short videos. A visual adaptation of current events or topics is the\u00a0general request. There is also the need to see \"bad news\" counterbalanced with positive news or examples of virtuous solutions to problems. Practically all young people who participated in the research complain about feeling drowned in negativity when watching traditional news. They also reported a feeling of information overload. They prefer more customised information to help them navigate the world of news they receive on their smartphones and save time. Then there is an interesting trend that we have identified, especially in Southern Switzerland: memes as a source of information through a two-step process. First the meme is received, usually through a direct\u00a0message; then, if the content of the meme looks interesting, the recipient runs a search on the topic or the news. It is one of many instances where young people, rather than actively seeking out information, bump into the news. \u00a0", "Why is the use of social media increasing among young people, and traditional media are no longer popular?", "\u00a0\u00a0", "This change concerns a general social change since it is not only young people who have shifted to social media. However, it also involves the timing of information consumption in young people. Our research has shown that most of them read the news and search for information on their\u00a0way to school or work, therefore when they are \u201con\u00a0the move,\u201d during breaks, and between activities. This behaviour inevitably relies on smartphones, which aggregate news and keep people occupied through social media and applications during their downtime. Access to traditional media\u00a0happens very rarely through smartphones. Traditional broadcast is\u00a0longer and less flexible than the videos found on social networks. Obviously, this is to the detriment of in-depth analysis and the variety of information. Young people have often told us that they have activated specific filters or have customised applications to receive only news related to interesting or useful topics. It shows that for them, the relationship between news, personal life, and personal interests is particularly important. In this sense, social media are ideal because they allow, and often urge, extreme customisation.\u00a0", "Another key point is that, for young people, information rhymes with entertainment; one of the main drivers of news consumption is, in fact, \"passing time\" and \"being entertained\". Therefore, it is not surprising that they choose the same channels to inform and entertain themselves: social media, search engines and video portals. In addition, the reasons why young people stay informed are linked to relational needs and self-interest: they read the news to engage in discussions about current topics at school or with their peers, to keep up to date with events that directly affect their daily lives (such as storms or criminal activity occurring in their geographic context), to learn about topics that affect their group of friends. Concerning these types of needs, social media offer more immediate, though less in-depth, or reliable, answers that are easier to reuse in everyday life than traditional media. \u00a0", "\u00a0\u00a0", "How critical is digital literacy to avoid becoming a victim of\u00a0misinformation?\u00a0\u00a0", "It is critical. We never tire of repeating that. The studies we conduct in Switzerland on both the relationship between media and young people and the relationship between young people and information, point to several issues that need to be addressed through initiatives in and out of schools to increase young people's media literacy and, above all, to vary their information consumption. Search engines and social media have conditioned young people to expect to find news and pieces of information quickly and easily. These tools have changed the very nature of \"searching\" for information and what it means to \"do research.\" For young people today, \"research\" means \"Googling.\" \"Doing research\" has gone from a relatively slow process driven by intellectual curiosity and a desire for discovery to a quick, short-term exercise aimed at finding just enough information to complete a task or meet an immediate need. The fact that today's youth is\u00a0so tech-savvy makes us believe that their ability to search for information about a video game or sports team will translate into the\u00a0ability to find news on current events easily. But the Internet is a black hole of information, and indeed, not all of it is accurate. Young people, even those most familiar with technology, need to be guided. For example, they should be taught how to use advanced search tools and shown how to access resources such as online databases, news media sites, books, or online libraries. Today's top priority should be teaching young people some criticism of online information. Research suggests that they are becoming less and less informed and, therefore, developing limited literacy in dealing with news, making this group more vulnerable to misinformation.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Does information adapt to the needs of young people?\u00a0\u00a0", "\u00a0", "It tries to do so, but not always effectively. At least if we look at consumption data or base ourselves on the observations collected in our research. Traditional media, such as newspapers, magazines and radio, or formats such as newscasts, have experienced a sharp decline for years among young people. This should be an incentive to change how we communicate with this population segment. However, it is not easy to understand how, and it is not by chance that the title of our study is also a question: how to reach young Swiss people with news?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "The results of our research, but this is also confirmed by other studies on the subject, underline the fact that traditional news programmes fail to involve young people even when dealing with topics that interest them. Rather than pursuing \"fresh\" and \"light\" topics, it would be useful to experiment with different formats instead.\u00a0Young people prefer visual formats, such as videos or images that recap and illustrate what is going on in the world. Also, a re-packaged and easy-to-absorb piece of information is rewarded with greater attention in terms of content.\u00a0News aggregators, apps, and push notifications are widely used precisely because of their way of condensing and delivering news.\u00a0", "It must be said that some successful experiments also exist in our area and have been repeatedly reported to us by young people. For example, SPAM, a format designed by RSI for the young generation and conceived for social media, was very successful and showed a different way of tailoring information to a younger audience. \u00a0", "There is also a critical time frame that we have identified in which young people are willing to be reached by the news, namely the 15-17 age group. People in this group are in a strategic phase. They are beginning to emancipate themselves from family habits concerning news consumption but have not yet consolidated their habits.\u00a0In this age group, young people think\u00a0it is essential to be informed about world events and to be able to form an opinion. Their attitude toward news is quite optimistic. For example, news is considered helpful for school and useful in daily life. Young people want to be informed to be able to take part in discussions at school or connect with peers. Even in this age group however, news consumption is driven by social media because it is \"the easiest way to access news.\" Between the ages of 15 and 17, content tracked on social is often a starting point for accessing different online news media, but only those that do not offer traditional formats.", " \u00a0", "\u00a0", "What are the future scenarios?", " \u00a0", "A critical battlefield, as mentioned, is that of the fight against disinformation. One of the issues that worries the young people who participated in our study is fake news and the consequent loss of media credibility. Unfortunately, this loss of trust impacts not only social media, considered by young people to be among the least reliable sources of information but also traditional media. It is why young people want to know who produces the news. In short, transparency is essential to them. It is no coincidence that they prefer news told in the first person because they consider it more trustworthy than news that is too \"packaged\" and impersonal. In this sense, the role of the so-called \"influencers\" or journalists close to their way of communicating is very important, though currently underestimated. \u00a0", "I also see great potential in memes. They might really become a means to spread information among a younger audience. There are well-established examples that show you can make journalism with memes, using them to get people into the middle of the story to find out the details. The meme is a piece of a mosaic, which can be larger or smaller, more or less detailed. The problem for those involved in memetic journalism is to figure out which piece of the mosaic to isolate to make people want to find out the rest, i.e. click and read or see the related information. Among the young people who participated in our study, the memes linked to the news they wanted to explore were not created or hosted by newspapers but circulated informally in private groups or on social networks, in contexts where misinformation spreads. However, the fact that they personally took action to find out more, analyzing the meme, going back to the original sources and then going on to read a series of articles on the subject, I think, tells us a lot about the fact that perhaps we should be careful about talking about young people's lack of interest or intellectual laziness. More than anything else, we observe a progressive distancing of young people from the traditional newscasts, but not because they don't want to be informed. Instead, it is because they do not identify with the information. However, there is still room to change this attitude, especially in Switzerland, where trust in public service and professional journalism is still very high among young people. "]},

Today the field of comparative literature has extended to include the entire world, reversing the idea of Weltliteratur foreshadowed by Goethe and relaunched in the twentieth century by Erich Auerbach. Among the perspectives adopted by the comparatist to investigate identities and differences between the works of literature of the world, there is traditionally the study of themes, genres, forms, currents and movements. Lately, the study of the relationships between literature and other media, codes, and expressive languages has been dramatically extended.", "For some time, it was believed that this study field dealt with freedom, and allowed us to trace its upward trajectory in history. But rather, it has to do with the extent that, by exercising patient observation of identities and differences, continuities and discrepancies, it teaches complexity, the awareness of which is an indispensable prelude to freedom understood as responsible commitment.", "When we talk about literature across cultures, what do we mean?", "Literature is among the most important organ of the living memory of cultures. It is mainly due to its nature as \"language facts\" and the central role the latter plays in defining cultures. The critic George Steiner wrote that, for the Jewish people, the homeland is the text (Our Homeland, the Text). With the necessary adaptations, this statement can be extended to all cultures.", "Comparative literature operates in this complex domain by adopting a perspective that a colleague of the University of Lausanne, Ute Heidmann, defines as dialogical and differential. Today such perspective is concerned not only with what is common across cultures (this has been the pre-eminent interest of comparative studies in the second half of the twentieth century) but also with what differentiates works of literature, and above all, diversity and multiplicity within the same national traditions. It can be a prelude to a more conscious encounter between cultures, especially starting from the awareness of the debt that each has contracted over time with the others.", "What is the \"right\" way to approach comparative literature?", "I do not think there is a \"right\" way to approach comparative literature: it would be a claim that contradicts the dialogical attitude I mentioned earlier. It is instead a matter of finding the most fruitful stance so that, as Walter Benjamin wrote, the border can become a threshold. It is not, in fact, a question of blurring the border, understood as a diversity of languages, traditions and forms, but rather of opening up spaces to foster encounter.", "From my point of view, the study of the transnational diffusion of texts, along the lines of what was once called \"fortuna\", is particularly fruitful. This approach has the advantage of preserving the centrality of the text and, therefore, of the language and the differences between languages. At the same time, as another critic, Martin Eisner, has argued, it combines historicism and formalism, sensitivity to the historical reality of literary relations and openness to more free comparisons between texts. Finally (and this is the new element with respect to research on the more traditional \"fortuna\"), it has a \"retroactive value\", as Massimo Fusillo has defined it, which allows us to shed new light on the so-called \"source-text\".", "In what way, in your opinion, also in the light of recent events, is it possible to \"extend the we-feeling\"?", "The phrase is by a great 20th-century comparatist, Claudio Guill\u00e9n, and it seems to me, in the framework of the considerations made so far, that it retains its validity.", "Comparative literature can \"extend the we-feeling\"; above all, I would like to point out that it can extend it in depth, rather than in scope, as awareness and knowledge of the plurality that, to a greater or lesser extent, inhabits all literature and cultures.", "I would refer to a current event linked to the tragic circumstances of the war in Ukraine. As is well known, the day after the invasion by the Russian army, the rector of an Italian university hastened to suspend a series of lectures dedicated to Dostoevsky. To many, myself included, this gesture appeared to be an unfair attribution of faults to literature or roots of faults, which almost certainly have their causes elsewhere. No one, however, has thought through the consequences of this gesture: how much of ourselves do we lose by erasing Dostoevsky from university courses? The Russian novelist was inspired by the Italian civilisation of criminal law: Prestupl\u00e9nie i nakaz\u00e0nie, the title traditionally translated as Crime and Punishment, is, in fact, precisely the title of the first Russian translation (1803) of Cesare Beccaria's Dei delitti e delle pene. More importantly, novels such as \"The Brothers Karamazov\" have been decisive for the growth of writers such as Pirandello or Ungaretti and, no less important, of countless Italian readers.", "Comparative literature contributes to extending the we-felling of the plurality that inhabits both our own and all literary traditions."]},

Senescence is a biological process where the cells do not proliferate, even if they are still metabolically active.

However, after an initial beneficial phase, persistent senescent tumor cells can promote tumor growth, migration, and even metastasis.", "Martina Troiani and Manuel Colucci, by using bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, have identified a class of compounds that selectively eliminates senescent tumors cells (Senolytic Therapy) and impair metastatic dissemination.

These findings created an unprecedented opportunity to describe senescent cancer cells. In fact, for the first time, the researchers have described senescent tumor cells as a highly heterogeneous population that ultimately relies on the same pro-survival gene: MCL-1. Nowadays, the gold standard in senolytic therapy targets BCL-2 (Navitoclax). However, about 50% of senescent cells do not rely on this factor but survive thanks to MCL-1.", "Therefore, Martina Troiani and Manuel Colucci, Ph.D. students co-first authors of this research, pharmacologically and genetically inhibit MCL-1 upon standard chemotherapy. The treatment results in growth inhibition and, more importantly, a significant decrease in metastatic formation.", "This big discovery could ameliorate the current chemotherapy done in the Molecular Oncology department, led by Prof. Andrea Alimonti, MD. ", "\u201cCells subjected to elevated stress such as treatment with anti-cancer therapies can make two choices: either die or remain suspended in between life and death, a condition known as cellular senescence. Thanks to the use of bioinformatic and machine learning algorithms, we have identified a novel target to eliminate senescent tumor cells and, therefore, prevent metastatic dissemination.\u201d ", "\u00a0", "Outlook", "The possibility to identify senescent tumor cells in terms of single cells and as a heterogeneous population will shed light on novel, precise therapy to ultimately ameliorate the potency of current chemotherapy. This idea was the rationale behind tailoring a bioinformatic approach to spot and describe senescent tumor cells. Andrea Alimonti laboratory has already paved the road to the tight connection between senescence and metastatic dissemination (Guccini et al, Cancer Cell 2021).

Let's start by understanding what relevance an Information System has for research?", "\u201cAn Information System has several functions: one is strategic, providing an up-to-date, real-time view of the progress of activities, funding and research products. This is not only at institutional level, with monitoring of the service contract between USI and the Canton, but also at the level of organisational units and research institutes; the other function is of a managerial nature. On the one hand, it makes it possible to manage the day-to-day flow in a more streamlined manner, e.g. the management of institute contracts and their progress, the monitoring of human resources, etc., and on the other to share information between the various services dealing with research (SRIT, controlling, human resources, Pro-Rectors)\u201d.", "For whom and for what purpose is such structured data needed?", "\u201cThe Information System provides for different types of data. There is data on the acquired research projects, which are important from a financial point of view but also as a reputational measure; data on PhD students, which, in addition to statistics, make it possible to observe - for example - the time in which PhD theses are completed or the so-called 'drop out rates', which are an indicator of the quality of doctoral education\u00a0. This data also make it possible to monitor the career path of PhDs (both at academic level and in industry and the public sector) and make it possible to understand what positions they obtain in the academic world. The Information System is therefore a very important tool for determining the effectiveness of doctoral education and, more generally, the quality of research.\u00a0", "The project also includes a module on scientific publications, managed by the USI University Libraries, which will make it possible to monitor the publication activities of researchers and institutes, and the research budget module, which will make it possible to quantify the university's research costs and the extent to which the university's income is linked to research activities.", "The levels of aggregation are crucial as they reflect the organisation and strategy of the university. The aim is to produce data divided by units of interest. As far as the field of research is concerned, the main unit of interest is the institutes, i.e. the facilities where research takes place\u201d.", "How did you define the most relevant indicators in the field of research projects?", "\u201cIt should be remembered that, in general, indicators are a field of study. There are journals and conferences on these indicators. I am part of this field as a professor in the Faculty of Communication, Culture and Society at USI. The indicators are modelled on international standards. The indicators on research projects are simple, they refer to the number of projects, or rather the financial volume that has been created. There are two indicators: acquired projects and annualised indicators. The former offer an immediate answer on the ability to acquire funds, the latter give a longitudinal view since all indicators are produced over time, since it is the trend that counts rather than the absolute level\u201d.", "Do you also see advantages for individual lecturers?", "\u201cYes, but I would call them indirect. I don't imagine that professors and teachers are going to consult their data on business intelligence, because they already know it. The advantages are indirect in the sense that the institution's knowledge of precise situations allows the professors to work more efficiently. If the Research and Knowledge Transfer Service contacts a professor for a submission strategy, being aware of the history of the projects won by the professor provides immediate mapping for prompt advice. The Information System is a tool that allows USI's services, the Pro-Rectors and the Rectorate to be precise in helping the academic body. Aggregated data is also interesting at community level, as it enables comparisons to be made within the university\u201d.", "In addition to bringing benefits in its field, this pilot project has made it possible to gain skills that will be useful in the implementation of subsequent business intelligence modules. In recent months, a module on the numbers of Bachelor's and Master's students' pre-enrolments has also been produced at the request of the Pro-Rector for Education and Students' experience, Professor Lorenzo Cantoni.

{"title": "Freedom and the humanities - The freedom of the artist", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20186", "description": ["The interview series \"Reflections on Freedom. A look at the humanities\" in collaboration with ISI, USI Institute of Italian Studies, continues. Carla Mazzarelli, professor of History of Modern Art at ISI and professor at the Institute for the History and Theory of Art and Architecture at the Academy of Architecture, talks about the relationship between the artist and freedom.", "Professor Mazzarelli, the artist's freedom is multifaceted, even in the collective imagination. Is it possible to draw up a sort of \"process\"? For example, starting from the freedom of invention?", "\u00a0", "Artists, since the Renaissance, have tried to express their freedom in many ways. One could tell the history of modern art and architecture as the story of continuous research carried out on a thin line: the respect for fundamental models, first of all, the ancient and nature, and the need to find an autonomy from those same models to define a new form of originality. \"Because in the novelty of such beautiful frames, capitals and bases, doors, tabernacles and tombs, he deviated from the measure, order and rule of the common use (...). This freedom has given a great impetus to those who have seen his work to imitate him (...) so that the artisans have an infinite and perpetual obligation to him since he has broken the bonds and chains of the common ways\". This is how Giorgio Vasari defines the freedom expressed by Michelangelo in the Sacrestia Nuova of San Lorenzo in Florence: freedom that generates new fantasies, not exempt from the 'danger' of making mistakes. But this is the risk of invention. Francesco Borromini explicitly refers to this freedom expressed in his time by Michelangelo when, in the middle of the seventeenth century, he reminds his clients that \"I certainly would not have entered this profession to be only a copyist (...)\".\u00a0", "Artists need clients. Can they remain free before their patrons?\u00a0", "There is no doubt that the art system is based on the artist-patron partnership during the modern age. Still, it is equally valid that the history of Renaissance art has provided us with essential elements useful for reconstructing the need, increasingly stressed by artists, for their creative freedom with respect to their patrons' pressing and often invasive requests. Baxandall recalled how the low consideration that Piero della Francesca shows to have towards the contract signed with the brotherhood of Mercy for the Polyptych today in Borgo San Sepolcro was the sign of a new conquered social and cultural status of the artist. It took him almost twenty years to deliver the work, even though the contract provided for its completion in three and the complete authorship. Evidently, in the middle of the 15th century, Piero could already afford \"licenses\" to others, indeed not granted in those same years.\u00a0", "Is it better to defend one's creative autonomy \"without ifs and buts\" or to give in to the lure of a sure profit?\u00a0", "Some of the artists called by Isabella d'Este to decorate her studio in Mantua, where the cultured patron dedicated herself to her pastimes, reading, studying and correspondence, were no different. The binding and detailed conditions imposed on her artists, including Leonardo, Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini, generated responses that were anything but unanimous. Giovanni Bellini declined the commission, revealing his disappointment in responding to such detailed requests that left little room for the painter's autonomy. Perugino, on the contrary, then active in Florence, for the work with the Fight between Love and Chastity, followed step by step the instructions of the patron and his advisers. First, the artist informed Isabella about any independent choice he had made, with respect to the requests, even if it was an extra figure or a scantily clad Venus. Then, she, pen and paper in hand, immediately reprimanded the painter. Although the painting was finally delivered, it is still not considered among the most successful of the Umbrian painter. Nevertheless, the freedom of the artist was already then, as today, a matter of individual choice.\u00a0", "From the free work to freedom as a necessity of the work\u00a0", "\"But if there is room left in the painting, I will adorn it with figures, according to inspiration\". This is how Paolo Veronese put it bluntly when summoned in 1573 before the tribunal of the Inquisition. The reasons the painter reaffirms the value of his creative choices with respect to the rules imposed by censorship give us evidence of a topical theme\u2014the artist's freedom despite the authorities.\u00a0", "On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that art has often assumed political meanings throughout the centuries, also becoming an instrument of the most distorted ideologies.\u00a0", "The 'forms' are bearers of identity values (or \"disvalues\"). It is no coincidence that the destruction, vandalism, and reappropriation of artistic and architectural heritage have often accompanied revolutions or wars of conquest. During the French Revolution, the link between art and politics was a burning issue in public debates and in the iconographic choices made by the artists themselves: this is the case of Jean-Louis David, who captured with his brush the \"martyrs of liberty\" such as Marat.\u00a0", "Even more than the word, the image has a strong persuasive power: it is direct, and even though it is \"silent\", it can shout and thus be engraved in the viewer's imagination. So often, the only trace left in every war, every abuse of power, is of the art that denounces, the art that resists. Faced with the triumph of inhumanity, \"acting\" is our \"art\", as Hannah Arendt recalled. Freedom thus becomes a necessity of the work, whether it be street art graffiti in a degraded suburb or the implacable lens of a photograph which, as Susan Sontag wrote, forces us not to look away from \"the pain of others\".\u00a0"]},

{"title": "Digital awareness: trust and the features health apps should have to make us trust them", "link": "https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/20735", "description": ["Digital awareness has gained importance in the public discourse in the past years. In other words, there is a growing need to anticipate, identify, and understand the nature of the opportunities and risks of digital technologies, so that they are not implemented and adopted hastily and without knowledge of their ethical, legal, and social implications. Among the many digital technologies available to us, health apps have a particular place because of their prolific and relentless development, their ever-growing commercial value, their increasing accessibility and user-friendliness, and their promise to improve our health and access to care and reduce mortality, hospitalisations, health care costs, and medical errors. But unfortunately, there is also a growing number of people using unreliable health apps. Despite these advances and promises, the relentless pace of health app development raises concerns about privacy and data protection. In addition, as data from health apps are increasingly integrated into medical decision-making, the issue of physician accountability arises. How do we determine that the app on which we place our hopes is actually based on scientific evidence? Such considerations highlight the ethical challenges that directly affect the accountability of digital health, that is, the set of health aspects related to the digital world. We tackle the issue with Marta Fadda, a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in the Biomedical Ethics course at the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences of Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana.", "What characteristics do these technologies need to have to be considered reliable and elicit our trust?\u00a0", "Before defining the characteristics that apps must exhibit to be perceived as trustworthy, it is essential to dwelling on the concept of trust itself. Trust is something that is given as individuals. It is never blind, nor is it given unconditionally or monolithically, but instead is a relational (between at least two parties) and multifactorial concept, which could be summarised in the following pattern proposed by philosopher Onora O'Neill:", "We trust if:\u00a0", "To trust in a health app means, according to this pattern, to relate to someone (in this case, the app developers) and to believe that they will provide health benefits under the banner of accuracy, integrity, and credibility. Trustworthiness refers to the attributes that cause an individual to consider another individual or entity worthy of their trust. To be perceived as reliable or trustworthy, developers must strategically flag their honesty, competence, and trustworthiness to make users feel comfortable putting their trust in them. A 2015 survey assessed why users adopt, abandon, or continue using health apps and found that distrust in developers is one of the main reasons many users discontinue using these tools. This distrust likely stems from the increased suspicion about developers' actual competence, honesty, and credibility.", "From content to user control...\u00a0", "Various checklists and scales are available to help users of health apps evaluate specific attributes underlying trustworthiness, such as quality and effectiveness. The checklist developed and published by van Haasteren in 2019 allows users to answer a series of questions about the app's information content, organisational features, social influence, technological features, and the control offered to the user to determine the degree of trustworthiness of the app they are going to use. Included are questions about measurement accuracy, any external certifications, security guidelines, the developer's reputation, privacy and data security considerations, and freedom of control.", "What conclusions can we draw here?", "Digital awareness necessarily passes through the concept of trust.

Of particular concern are attacks that target critical infrastructure, such as hospitals or power plants. Such attacks have happened with increasing frequency in recent years, e.g., the ransomware attack on Ireland\u2019s public healthcare provider, the ransomware attack on an Oil pipeline in the U.S., or the attack on a water treatment plant in Florida that almost succeeded in increasing the levels of a certain chemical in the water to dangerous levels \u2013 all in 2021.", "\u00a0", "How are cyber-attacks becoming another front in a war?", "Disrupting critical infrastructure has always been a popular tactics in a war, though in the past this was mostly restricted to physical destruction, e.g., of bridges or power plants. With today\u2019s increased digitalisation, it is far cheaper to have a \u201chacker\u201d team attack such critical infrastructure from the safety of an office far away from the front lines. Yet the impact of, e.g., shutting down the systems of a power plant through a targeted cyber-attack may be just as effective as trying to take it out in an air strike. Similarly, breaking into state computers might provide an attacker with important tactical information that may be vital for deploying troops in a battlefield.", "\u00a0", "Can we define the Ukrainian- Russian conflict as a hybrid war?", "Very much so. Many Russian government services have been using state-run \u201chacker\u201d groups for years, e.g., the Russian Federal Security Service FSB (the successor to the KGB) is running a group called \u201cBerserk Bear\u201d, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service SVR is running a group called \u201cCozy Bear\u201d, and the Russian military intelligence agency GRU is running a group called \u201cFancy Bear\u201d. These groups are thought to be responsible for several high-profile attacks in recent years, such as the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in 2020, an attack on a U.S. nuclear power plant in 2014, or an attack on the Estonian parliament in 2007. All of these attacks have been made without any open conflict between Russia and the involved countries. It is thus no surprise that a \u201creal\u201d war will also contain many elements of cyberwarfare.
